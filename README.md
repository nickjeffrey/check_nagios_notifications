# check_nagios_notifications
Nagios check to confirm notifications are enabled

# Purpose
Sysadmins will sometimes turn nagios notifications off during a scheduled maintenance window, and forget to turn notifications back on.

This check will automatically turn notifications on if they have been globally disabled for more than 24 hours.
